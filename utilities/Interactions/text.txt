############ User Select ##########
- default value of user-select is  user-select:auto 
- from _utilities.scss =>
 "user-select": (
    property: user-select,
    values: all auto none
)
.user-select-all{
    user-select:all !important;
}
.user-select-auto{
    user-select:auto !important;
}
.user-select-none{
    user-select:none !important;
}

- none : The text of the element and its sub-elements is not selectable.
- all : The content of the element shall be selected atomically: If a selection would contain part of the element,
         then the selection must contain the entire element including all its descendants. 
         If a double-click or context-click occurred in sub-elements, the highest ancestor with this value will be selected.

- auto : The used value of auto is determined as follows:

            - On the ::before and ::after pseudo elements, the used value is none
            - Otherwise, if the used value of user-select on the parent of this element is all, the used value is all
            - Otherwise, if the used value of user-select on the parent of this element is none, the used value is none
            - Otherwise, the used value is text 
                - text : The text can be selected by the user.



############## Pointer Event #########

- Bootstrap provides .pe-none and .pe-auto classes to prevent or add element interactions
- from _utilities.scss =>
"pointer-events": (
      property: pointer-events,
      class: pe,
      values: none auto,
    )

.pe-none{
    pointer-events : none !important ;
}
.pe-auto{
    pointer-events : auto !important ;
}

- auto : The element behaves as it would if the pointer-events property were not specified
- none : The element is never the target of pointer events; however, 
            pointer events may target its descendant elements if those descendants have pointer-events set to some other value,
            because pointer events property is heritable .
        
- tabindex="-1" : means that the element is not reachable via sequential keyboard navigation  (to prevent them from receiving keyboard focus)
- aria-disabled="true" : state indicates that the element is perceivable but disabled, so it is not editable or otherwise operable
    (to convey the fact they are effectively disabled to assistive technologies)
