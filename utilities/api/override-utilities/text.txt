############# Override utilities  #########
- Override or modify  existing utilities by using the same key
- map-merge($map1 ,$map2) :
    - If both $map1 and $map2 have the same key, $map2â€˜s value takes precedence.
    - All keys in the returned map that also appear in $map1 have the same order as in $map1. New keys from $map2 appear at the end of the map.
